How many hosts have you installed using fai? <b>~1000 workstations</b>, 500+ cluster nodes

Which version of fai are you using? <b>3.4.4</b>, 3.1.8, 3.2.17

Which version are you using as your install kernel? lenny, squeeze: plain Debian kernel
        etch: backported 2.6.26 or 2.6.32 kernel from lenny/squeeze

Which types of hosts are you installing with fai? desktops, laptops, infrastructure servers, cluster nodes

How do you boot your hosts?
 via network (PXE, DHCP): for cluster nodes
	  from USB stick: with a custom build

Does the default install kernel recognize all your hardware?
        We make it so, usually by backporting more recent kernels from Debian.
Which drivers are missing? Usually WiFi, sometimes SATA or GigE.

Do you manage your configuration space under version control? Yes, SVN.
How big is your config space (Mbytes, # of files)? A couple MB, < 100 files
How many files do you have in ../config/files? Not much.
        The bulk of the configuration is managed through
        configurationpackages. Software selection is managed through a
        set of ca. 100 metapackages.

What types of scripts are you using for local customization? Configuration packages, using custom scripts and cfengine.

<br><b>Additional comments:</b> 
We use a custom-built CD to boot our install clients, except for cluster
nodes. The CD embarks the kernel and an initrd with a config script
asking a couple of questions and setting up variables used later on by
FAI scripts & hooks. Thanks to syslinux/isolinux we use the same build
to make bootable USB keys. We also make a bootable USB hard drive
containing a full Debian mirror along with the FAI NFSROOT and
configspace; a standalone install media.

I perform only a very basic installation for workstations: the
install target is text mode only, with openssh-server, cfengine2,
krb5, and AFS client working. I have quite a bit of cfengine and
perl scripting to complete this to either a workstation or a
computing node.

Servers install allmost to a deployment ready state.

Currently I am working an automating notebook installs - including
desktop environment and power-management. This work should later
improve our desktop installation.

<b>What is the business of your company/organisation?</b> <a href="http://go.warwick.ac.uk/stats">Department of Statistics</a>, University of Warwick.  
<br><b>Additional comments:</b> 
We use FAI to standardise our cluster node installations for a small Departmental
cluster (<a href="pictures/statistics_warwick.jpg">picture</a>) here at Warwick. We find this preferable to disk imaging
as we occasionally add new nodes, and so end up with a heterogeneous cluster.

In general, I would say that I find FAI pretty powerful. My only criticism would
be that it is sometimes difficult to migrate to new versions: for example, I had
to re-write my fai/config directory just recently during a system upgrade from
Ubuntu 8.04 to 10.04. Other than that, it has been fairly painless, apart from a
lot of work choosing which packaged to install on my execution nodes!

Many thanks for your hard work on what looks to be a very promising,
useful, and long lived project.

<br><b>Additional comments:</b> 
  Trying to minimise the scripts in fai, because we're trying to bootstrap only with fai,
  so configuration and customisation comes from puppet. This is a "general"
  problem, that every installation method (debian-installer, fai, kickstart, ...)
  has: if relying on the installation system, one spreads around the configuration.

  Thus we think that having a minimal system that supports only (some) configuration
  system, is the best way to go.

  Using fai is pretty straight forwarded, having the "log service" is
  very useful, though at the beginning not completly clear where to put
  the ssh keys and what's needed to get them into the chroot.

All of our servers are built using FAI. Currently we have
approximately 700 servers across 2 datacenters, and we use FAI to
bootstrap all of them. We don't use FAI for our office machines.

Our installation is pretty small because we rely on FAI to get servers
up to the point where Puppet can take over to finish the configuration
of the system. FAI is a pretty critical component of our
infrastructure because it makes reprovisioning a machine cheaper than
reconfiguring, which saves us a lot of time and headache
troubleshooting lifecycle-related problems.

This is a private test install to test various use cases - from very
basic things like DHCP/DNS/Firewalling to topics like Terminal
Services, Asterisk, VPN scenarios, central authentication
services/SSO, and so on. In all this, FAI plays an inherent role from
the very beginning. The nice thing is, with the help of FAI I can
setup the whole infrastructure with a single command! For my private
use at home I use FAI as well - which is a bit of overkill, I know -
but it's relieving to know that even in a worst-case-scenario I can
have my systems up'n'running in no time and with minimal effort
involved.

We currently using FAI to install all Debian hosts, in various
locations across the globe. We have been using FAI since Debian
3.1. FAI allows users to re-image their own desktop machines when we
move from one version of Debian to the next to support development of
our product (MATLAB/Simulink). PXE files are put in place on our PXE
servers, allowing users a one-click install (press F12 during boot).

All hosts are PXE booted, and the nfsroot, FAI config, and package
repository are all served over NFS via NetApp filers. We find this
method to be very robust and efficient. 

I am currently investigating the usage of FAI to build Ubuntu clients,
with good success so far. We currently manually install Ubuntu
clients, though the number of these hosts is currently <20 test
machines. (http://www.sourcecode.de/content/ubuntu-910-and-fai)

Thank you for making multiple client installations so easy with the use of FAI! Keep up the great work!

  FAI's main focus is to provide consistent default installations according
  to our installation standard, it is set up in a way you only need to choose
  the operation system. FAI_FLAGS to customize the installation details are being
  set automatically according to the specifics of the hardware / virtual machine

  Our FAI-server is able to create customized servers (packages, user,
  ssh-keys etc. are individually configurable)

How many hosts have you installed using fai? We are using FAI with about <b>1000</b> hosts.

Which version of fai are you using? <b>3.2.20</b>, and some oldest setups with 3.2.17 or 3.1.8.

Which version are you using as your install kernel? 
  - Plain GNU/Linux Debian Etch and Lenny kernels
  - Custom kernels built with Grsecurity patch or Sun Microsystem Lustre
    patch, or more recent kernels like 2.6.30 both custom and

<br /><b>Additional comments:</b> 
  We have only one FAI server (2 before that, but configuration were merged, and
  a wrapper written for making nfsroot with `make-fai-nfsroot' for multiple distributions).

  FAI is used at BUF to create the base system setup on our hosts. All
  configuration is managed after that with a Cfengine system.

<br /><b>Additional comments:</b> 
Hi - thanks for building FAI.  It's by far the best system for
provisioning and maintaining software on multiple systems that I've
used.

For reference while reading the answers, we're a managed service
provider.  We install 100+ nodes into every customer installation,
along with an FAI server. The nodes are custom-built embedded linux
boxes which are bootstrapped with debian when they'r manufactured in
our factory.  When a node is bootstrapped we have one hook script that
goes out to look for installation instructions. Our provisioning
process for a new customer looks like this:

INSTALLATION

1) Use an in-house instance of FAI to provision a server, which among
   other things becomes an FAI server

2) Install the server at the customer site

3) Install our nodes at the customer site, each of which have been
   bootstrapped without FAI in our factory with base debian plus a hook
   script to ask how to install software

4) The node gets instructions to run fai -N softupdate

5) Presto - 100+ working nodes in about 15 minutes each.


UPGRADE - How we upgrade our software at the customer site

1) Update a configuration file centrally to update the version of
   software which should be installed at the customer - this actually
   manifests as a versioned etch distribution with our software added to
   the distro

2) Shell in to the customer's server and run fai -N softupdate

3) Every node runs softupdate once every 2 hours and waits a random
   amount of time so as to not overload the network or the FAI server

4) Presto - Everything just works

We used to use the local debian mirror at ftp.rz.uni-wuerzburg.de, but
it was too slow, so we have a local (meaning in the same subnet with
GBit access). This decreased our install-time from over 2 hours down to
30 minutes for all boxes. The default setup on the clients occupies 11GB
diskspace (plain debian packages...)

We use it for the computer labs in the mathematics departments of the university of Wuerzburg.

We use FAI to install all our Linux machines. Years ago we were mainly
using Solaris and used Jumpstart in a similar way. In our first setup
of Linux we used Redhat with Kickstart. I was very happy when I
discovered FAI. It took me some time to convince the management, but
starting with Debian sarge we switched over to Debian/FAI. 
We also use FAI sometimes in sysinfo mode for diagnostic purposes.

<br /><b>Additional comments:</b> 
I am setting up a edubuntu school network on behalf of the church I
attend, Romaine Park Christian Centre It is made up from donated
hardware in Tasmania (au) that is about to be packed into a container
this weekend (along with a heap of tools & hospital equipment) &
dispatched to a school in Ndola Zambia.  It is a HP Proliant ML350 G3
server running 2 backend networks.  Net#1 pxe-boots diskless ltsp
clients - edubuntu ltsp straight from the jar.  Net#2 pxe-boots fai.
These desktops are 1.6GHz Acer Veriton 5600.  They are capable of full
multi-media & graphics that the ltsp network & server does poorly.  I
want the Net#2 desktops to end up configured with edubuntu-standard,
nfs /home (roaming desktop) & nis domain login, so they end up with a
similar environment to the ltsp network.

If I get  time & support... I plan  to travel with a team  to Ndola to
assist with the installation June 2009.  Also, time permitting we will
be setting up a  Internet kiosk for a mission in Ndola.   It will be a
dual backend similar to the school.

Net#1 will be pxe-boot ltsp -kiosk.  This is a local X running firefox
in the root window (which is great until a pop-up comes along...)
Net#2 will be a desktop pxe-boot fai build of a kiosk client that will
be a locked-down ubuntu desktop.

Tue, 07 Jul 2009 05:56:50 +1000
Just a quick update.  Our container arrived in Ndola Zambia near the end
of June.  We managed to squeeze in 76 destops, 5 servers 3 UPS +
monitors amongst all the other gear.  We leave Tasmania on the 16th July
& start the rollout ~20th.

<br /><b>Additional comments:</b> 
The desktops are distributed in the complete building (and normally
switched off), and the laptops are only sometimes connected to the
network. In order to be able to install updates, correct bugs and to
install new software, we use the softupdate-functionallity of
FAI. Whenever a machine is connected to the network, it checks
regularly whether a softupdate is necessary (by comparing the version
of the config-space with the local version) and starts (if necessary)
a softupdate automatically in the background.

How many hosts have you installed using fai? <b>at least ten</b> (about 50 using setup_harddisks)

Which version of fai are you using? <b>3.2.10</b> (had to patch it for parted)

Which version are you using as your install kernel? plain Debian kernel

Which types of hosts are you installing with fai?
	the servers are for small businesses
	they are firewalls using NAT
	they run bind, dhcpd, squid and samba by default
	some of them run email, apache, webdav
	the small businesses aren't using desktops yet, so
	the only desktops are the ones for the business (laptops also)

How do you boot your hosts?
       via network card:
   type of network card:
              PXE, DHCP: (most machines use pxe now)
	(I make sure the servers use pxe before they are bought)

Does the default install kernel recognize all your hardware? not always on laptops
Which drivers are missing? mostly wireless, sometimes ethernet or ide
Do you manage your configuration space under version control? postgresql, subversion
   I use a postgresql database that's exported imported from subversion repository
How big is your config space (Mbytes, # of files)? 7.8MB, 1490 files
   a lot of this is copies from suite to suite and many files are identical
   most of this is xml, scripts and templates that are imported into database

How many files do you have in ../config/files? I'm using a different
   config system, only using FAI to setup the disks

<b>What is the business of your company/organisation?</b> the company is out of business now
<br /><b>Additional comments:</b> 
I'm not really using FAI to install the systems.  I'm only using it to 
prepare the disks, and ready the system for the install.  I really like the 
way the disks are setup and formatted.  It makes things a lot easier.  My 
focus hasn't been on installing a network full of machines.  Rather, the 
focus has been placed on installing (and sometimes updating) preconfigured 
servers that are then placed in their environments.  A fully automatic system 
helps insure that the installation is complete and correct and helps keeps simple 
mistakes from occuring, and helps to keep the systems predictable.  This is 
really important the more complex and involved that the configuration gets.  I 
often spend more time getting a correct configuration than I would by just installing 
and configuring a server, but in the end, once the configuration is correct and has 
been tested, I have an easier time making the next machine, or reinstalling another 
machine that has died due to hardware problems.

We use FAI for all desktop computers we give to our customers. We 
receive machines from the manufacturer, then, we plug machines on the 
network then, they boot FAI. We then choose which CLASS to use, in 
function of the customer, then, it's automatically installed/configured.

We use FAI to build all Linux systems.  This allows less skilled workers
to perform systems builds.  We maintain machines in two countries, plus
newer laptops, machines donated to church members, computer lab
machines, and all of our servers with this system.  It works great, and
takes the guesswork out of machine builds.  It also allows us to upgrade
a machine clearly.  (Back up data, perform build with same profile
against newer repo and newer FAI version.)

unterschiedliche FAI-Installationen. Der Großteil der Installationen
erfolgt über PXE+DHCP, einige ältere Rechner werden über eine Boot-CD
angesprochen, die sich dann mit dem NFS-Server verbindet (die

<br /><b>Additional comments:</b> 
After using solaris jumpstart for many years, fai was a very natural 
choice when we made the transition to linux in 2004. It was in fact one 
of the main reasons for choosing debian. The other reasons were 
debians stability and total lack of commercial interests.

We use fai to install lab computers, mainly used by computer engineering 
students. All configuration after the initial install is done using 
softupdate to maintain a consistent installation. Softupdate is done 
manually with cssh.

Configuration is preferably done with cfengine scripts to avoid too much 
editing when upgrading to a new debian version.

For non debian software (firefox, thunderbird, matlab, maple, sun jdk, 
specific eclipse versions and more), we create local debian packages and 
add them to our own repository.

I'm blind so I have written a script to query our mysql database for
configuration setting. This script then prints class names that
determine how the install will be performed. For example, if a flag is
set in the database indicating that the machine should be dual-boot,
Windows and linux, the disk partitioning preserves the first existing
partition. This way I don't even have to have a monitor on a machine
when performing an FAI install.

  For Debian sarge (amd64) I build a new one from kernel.org, but
     maybe just because I tried with i386 fai-kernel. So I cannot tell
     for sure. But there was a driver missing (I think for

install, with openssh-server, cfengine2, krb5, and AFS client working. I have
quite a bit of cfengine and perl scripting to complete this to either a

experience with FAI I plan to install ready to use AFS file servers without
any postinstall steps.

Thank you for creating FAI. It's a wonderful piece of software which has
saved me a LOT of time! Thank you very much.

get messed up by student installations every day, or have different

We may stop using FAI, as there is a fault in the v3 installation that
I cannot diagnose; if the documentation were there, I may be able to
fix it. The lack of up-to-date documentation is more important than
releasing v3.2!

<br /><b>Additional comments:</b> 
We run all of our core infrastructure (Kerberos, AFS, web, DNS, etc.) on
Debian and do all Debian installs via FAI.  So almost entirely servers,
although some of us do install our desktop systems via FAI.  We don't have
any clusters yet, beyond some simple remote timeshare systems, but when we
do we'll install them via FAI.

Note that we use one system to FAI build sarge and etch for both
i386 and amd64 systems, so our setup is somewhat different and a little
more flexible than most FAI systems.

We also use bundle to do install-time actions instead of Cfengine or
fcopy, since it's a lot easier to deal with.  See:
    http://www.eyrie.org/~eagle/software/bundle/
to see what bundle is.

    One test system so far, at least 15 more to come once our setup is
    satisfactory (we're migrating from SuSE to Debian etch, cleaning up
    our installation policy, and using proprietary and own software needing
    to be packaged, so there's some work to do).

    Our main goal when using FAI is to be able to rebuild a host in case
    of a hardware defect with a minimum of attention required.
    Aside from that, the transition from SuSE to Debian is bound to be much
    less painful if you can have the whole network complete it in a matter
    of something like 20 minutes. No, we won't do *all* at once ;-), but we
    obviously won't need to manually install each computer individually.

<b>What is the business of your company/organisation?</b> Production of autonomous control
<br /><b>Additional comments:</b> 
Small computer systems (mini-ITX) are used for autonomous control, with
a Linux base and proprietory application software. FAI is used to
install all software during system assembly.

FAI is a prety good design which is very flexible. As a downside of
this, it is also very complex. The FAI manual is too short, and it was
not straightforward to use. In my case, 2 different systems are
installed (same hardware), which under-utilises FAI's capabilities by a
long shot. Consequently much time has been wasted setting up FAI, though
obviously a perhaps not so good decision of my predecessor isn't FAI's
fault. I'll remove FAI from the project if I can. E.g. autoyast may not
be as capable, but would have been much faster and sufficient for the
job. Also, FAI is mono-cultural (it only works with Debian), and I
object to sinking a lot of effort into something non-portable because it
reduces my flexibility (of moving away from Debian in this case). You
could say the same about autoyast, however the effort investment with
that is much smaller, and it's not the only alternative by far - cloning
a disk springs to mind, distro-independent, and disk space costs dirt
compared with engineering time.

Thanks for the software!

<br /><b>Additional comments:</b> 
Floppy boot is essential since I have one type of netcard (dmfe driver
under linux) which is ill-supported by rom-o-matic and I have no other option
than put a full kernel on floppy.

I have set up FAI to install a copy of the install kernel on all 
hosts automatically, and add that to the Grub menu. So as long as
I do not upgrade the install kernel, I can do a re-install via
a simple disk-reboot.

I think these (the files in fai/files) came from the demo setup which
I used to start my development. I rarely (if at all) use the files
feature.  The systems are customized at the "scripts" stage using
cfengine.  The cfengine configuration file is > 1000 lines , 47 kbytes
and about 100 config files are installed by it.

I have ever only used the (new) debian-installer once - to get the
first installation server off the ground. I found it a step back
from the old install-floppies when advanced changes were the goal.
However, I had planned to switch to FAI already then, and I have
never had to regret.

So far it seems like something I could find a use for. Many people 
(myself included) find reinstall's to be a time consuming process. What 
makes this worse is when you need to reinstall when your not prepared 
for it. I believe FAI helps by making you put in the "hard work" at the 
begining of your network by getting all of the replication, installation 
and other routines implemented and tested ahead of time. The result if 
that when you finally do need to reinstall a machine, chances are you 
just need to pop in a boot disk and walk away.

Previously we installed Ubuntu Hoary using PXE and an old static image

Using FAI we update the package list for clients, and let the clients 
perform a real aptitude install.  This is much cleaner.

Using a partition hook I was able to backup user data to the network, 
re-partition the disk, setup LVM and restore user data.  

N.B.: I have bundled 215 /usr/local/ files (our own scripts and 
stuff) in a tarball, as moving these into the config tree would get 
messy.

<br /><b>Additional comments:</b> 
We maintain a software engineering development lab using FAI
extensively. Over 300 hosts are configured to install via FAI. Since
we also maintain our own debian repository, we use FAI to keep these
hosts all up to date with respect to all the "correct" packages.

Because of the number of systems, we incur a significant number of
hard drive failures, as well as require drive-size upgrades fairly
often. FAI is indispensible for getting a host back into the testing
infrastructure quickly and correctly!

By creating a 'refai' script which frobs the boot sector of the drive,
and setting our default BIOS configuration to boot first from the
internal hard drive, then the NIC, we've allowed our our developers to
"make a mess" of a machine and be able to quickly get it back in
"pre-mucking-with" order consistently, quickly, and predictably.

We use FAI to bootstrap a minimal Debian installation and cfengine2 to 
install all needed software and configure the systems.

Currently one test system, but we'll use it a lot more now we've set this up. As a start,
we'll bring up a new anti-spam/virus cluster. After that, we'll probably start upgrading
some existing Linux systems as well.

About our setup: we first installed a Debian system and then the fai packages. After that,
we copied all neccessary data (nfsroot, config space and /boot) to our dedicated 
Sparc/Solaris system that is used for jumpstarting different kinds of systems. This 
jumpstart environment already had a pxelinux boot environment, so we simply extended this
environment to support the FAI setup as well. Works like a charm!

We use FAI primarily for configuration management and change control
for our server infrastructure. Every configuration element of our
servers is managed, and (almost) every box can be rebuilt
automatically.  Our webservers work in a IPVS cluster, a new server
will install itself and download the webroot without any user
interaction, we only need to tell our loadbalancer that it exists. The
main machines that are not currently FAI'd are some of our bigger
database servers, which use LVM - and we have not quite done enough
work to get FAI and LVM to work nicely.

<br /><b>Additional comments:</b> 
FAI is mainly used in our test/development network, where we often
have to re-install servers for a variety of tasks. I keep all the
servers FAI'ed up, and modify the DHCP server to give the machine a
boot file when I want to reinstall it. I've modified fai-monitor to
look for "installation complete" events and reconfigure the DHCP
server before the machine reboots. 

I'm using FAI mainly as a super-powered reset button. Once I have the
system up and running and SSH-able, I use my own scripts to customise
the machine. The idea is to create an environment where I can build
whatever server the situation requires, whenever I want.

One of the things I would be very interested in is to port the FAI
installation resources to one of our AIX machines. That way, I can
install both AIX machines and Debian boxen from the same AIX
server.

We've used FAI to primarily bootstrap compute nodes, but we're slowly adding
to our FAI install so that we can bring up full nodes quickly if a node ever

To deploy and auto update Ubuntu and Debian systems through our department.  Although FAI has
saved us time and time again, udev continuously presents problems.  I ended up having to give a 
hack of a workaround like this:

#### .../fai/hooks/configure.DEFAULT ####
if [ -x $target/etc/init.d/udev ]; then
   chroot $target /etc/init.d/udev stop
   chroot $target /usr/bin/dpkg --configure --pending
   chroot $target /etc/init.d/udev start
fi

Recentently we ran into a problem with hal and udev.  I had to create special udev rules because
we didn't want to add all of our users to the cdrom, plugdev, etc groups in LDAP.  So I made udev
create all the devices with the users group.  Hal ended up having to be added to the users group to
work properly.  

Also, we ran into a situation where we have a networking lab with a master node that has a single
connection to the outside world and all other machines were on a private network connected
to the master node.  So I ended up creating a FAI installation that installs an FAI server that all
other networking lab machines can install off of.  That was fun :)  That's also why my .../fai/files
is so large.

How many hosts have you installed using fai? <b>a few hundred</b>, unless you
   count each installation on our test station (several hundred by itself)
Which version of fai are you using? <b>2.6.3</b> plus fai-bootcd 0.3.4
   We are now in the process of updating to the latest fai (in debian testing)

Which version of fai-kernels are you using? Custom built 2.4, derived from from fai-kernels 1.8
   (soon to be the standard 2.6 FAI kernel)

Which types of hosts are you installing with fai? Rack mount servers, in pairs. I'd also like to use FAI on our development boxes.

How do you boot your hosts? Using fai-bootcd, soon to be fai-cd.

Does the default install kernel recognize all your hardware?
   The 2.4 kernel didn't meet the requirements for fai-bootcd so we
   recompiled to include those. The 2.6 kernel seems to have everything we need.

<b>What is the business of your company/organisation?</b> <a href=http://www.key.net/>Key Technology</a>. We manufacture and sell food processing equipment
  (mostly sorters and conveyors).
<br /><b>Additional comments:</b> 
We use FAI to install and update software on production machines both
on our production floor and in the field. FAI makes the software
installation fast and easy for our production and field service
personnel. It also makes handling service calls easy because we KNOW
what's installed.

Our build servers automatically detect when source files have changed.
They build, test, and package the various software components. One
build server is dedicated to detecting new packages and automatically
building an fai-bootcd ISO.

<a href=pictures/DSCN1786.JPG>Picture of our machines</a>.
The pair of linux boxes on which we use FAI are just above the
UPS. The lower one runs our UI while the upper one does real-time
processing.  The remainder of the 1U rack mount boxes house custom
boards with embedded processors for real-time image processing. The
embedded processors also run uClinux.

We're using FAI to maintain the large amount of Debian workstations 
here. We have a large number of different hardware configurations. FAI 
does the job very well to handle these in a easy way. Before we used FAI 
we had to do the boring installation via Debian installer each time we 
installed a workstation. Transfer of common configurations was made via 
cfengine and a small script. (Cfengine in woody and the backport was 
horrible, the cfengine daemon often died and took 100% of the CPU until 
we finally killed him)
The installation of Sarge via FAI was remarkably fast. Compared to the 
several weeks for the switch from SuSE to Debian Woody (by hand), we 
only needed several days to update the workstations to sarge (it took 
several days because of organizational problems)

 20 HP DL585 / 385 servers (various 2 or 4 CPU dual core Opteron, 64bit OS)

 Our deployed software stack is 725MB. Installation time on an LS20 blade
 is 153 seconds. (Machines have scsi disks, and we have a local debian mirror)

 As well as using FAI to install the OS, we also use FAI to "pre-install"
 the machines. The "Pre-installation" stage flashes and configures the
 BIOS and configures hardware raid controllers.

 We run two fai servers, one for installing x86 machines, and one for installing
 AMD64 machines. (I suspect that we should be able to consolidate onto one FAI server,
 as /usr/local/share/fai is also identical on the AMD64 and x86 servers).

17 Mar 2004: We've used numerous automatic installers (IBM csm, RLX control tower, redhat
kickstart), and FAI is the fastest and the most flexible.

      (eg.: kernel 2.4 from fai-kernels 1.8)
      (eg.: custom build kernel 2.6)
so far as i know, i'm using 'stock debian 2.6.8-2'

How do you boot your hosts? fai-cd exclusively. For reproducability of procedure.

Does the default install kernel recognize all your hardware? So far, everything is supported.

<b>What is the business of your company/organisation?</b> Financial image processing
<br /><b>Additional comments:</b> 
FAI-CD is now my primary install method, and FAI alone used to be my
primary install method on my clusters.

We use FAI for the reproducability factor. By burning a FAI-CD of our
servers/software, we can at any time revert to a previous version, or
perform disaster recovery. No "system administration" is performed on
live servers. 

I've already got my subversion account for backporting/merging my patches.

Our production desktops and batch cluster nodes are running NFS rooted,
creation of both the NFS root images and the local /var and /tmp shall
be done with FAI in the future.

We are currently becoming quite fond of FAI.
In the long term our complete Debian installation (currently 500+
servers, desktops and cluster nodes) will be done with FAI. For our
current Woody-to-Sarge-transition we are even evaluating if a
reinstallation using FAI is more feasable then a normal upgrade from
Woody to Sarge in some cases (simple services)
It will surely become a central part of our infrastructure management
framework.

Do you have some nice pictures of your installation?
Maybe we can shoot some impressive pictures after the installation of
our 100+ new double Opteron Dual Core boxes in Q4.

Also FAI is used to reinstall a sandbox server which users may test & play

the packages and configuration files are added simply to the FAI class.

I had initial problems that have been solved in cooperation with the
author(s) and a great community. Most of the trouble came from having
to install very different hosts, x86 as well as amd64, with very
different hardware-setup and uses. Not your usual setup, I guess.
Also not being able to have one's own DHCP-server is a pain. We're now
installing a small cluster as well as different workstations and some
servers. All going well so far. :-)

<br /><b>Additional comments:</b> 
FAI is used to install fresh servers for our service platform, it's
also used to reinstall servers that are already in the datacenter
without moving to this place (25km for work). I just installed 2 NICs
in the FAI server, one public interface and one private with all my
gateways as aliases, the private interface is in a special VLAN and
I'm doing netfilter NAT between the private and the public interface
to get access to the "outside". To reinstall a server I just need to
change it's VLAN and reinstall it. I got to do that cause I use 2
repositories, none of them is on the FAI machine.

How many hosts have you installed using fai? <a>approximately 70</b> machines have been installed
Which version of fai are you using? <b>2.6.3</b>
   at the present time i am using 2.6.3. i had upgraded to 2.6.6 but
   was having some problems with the install being unable to resolve
   names so i went back to 2.6.3 and it worked fine.

Which version of fai-kernels are you using? none, using a custom kernel 2.4.26

    How do you boot your host? Two types of installation were done:
 1) 16 node beowulf cluster amd athlon 2600 which used dhcp on the
    headnode and pxe to install the clients. card was 3c996b-t (gigabit).
 2) various desktop machines boot with cdrom and dhcp.

  personally, i have found the docs to be very extensive, but rather
  confusing and at times misleading and/or out of date. the latter is
  obviously largely due to the fact that fai seems to be evolving
  rather quickly. still, it should be noted that i have resolved my
  problems mostly by reading the mailing list and the source (very
  readable, by the way), rather than the official documentation.

  i would like to suggest that the following be added to the documentation:

  -- the addition of a flow-chart or some other high-altitude flyover of the fai 
     boot process to the docs.

  -- a wikification of the fai documentation process. fai seems to have
     a rather supportive community. decentralizing the documentation process
     might help in keeping its large body of documentation well-written, 
     accurate and up-to-date.

Debian is the official Unix-like system at the <a

and all our machines are installed using FAI. It makes it easy for us
to start all the machines off in the same configuration. We've found
FAI to be flexible enough to handle the installation of numerous
different types of system (including multiple Debian versions) with
widely varying hardware and software configurations. It often takes
some hacking to get things completely right, but the framework is
there and is very usable. Additionally, we've found FAI's fcopy
utility to be very useful for maintaining systems after installation
(though we have hacked it slightly to be quiet in the case where it
doesn't actually copy any file).  </pre> <hr />

We are using FAI to setup a small networking testbed which is used by 2 
different projects. We need to be able to quickly reconfigure the 
network configuration and install new software on all hosts. Also we can 
now modify individual hosts for testing purposes and if anything goes 
wrong simply reinstall that machine.

3 of our hosts are quite different from the rest, e.g., they are not 
able to boot from the network card, 2 of them have SCSI harddisks, while 
the others have IDE harddisks, 1 host has two harddisks etc. 
Nevertheless we managed to setup a fai configuration with which we can 
install all hosts the same way (but using different disk configurations, 
special chboot hooks etc.). We are always booting over the network. 
Fortunately, all hosts are able to run with the default fai-kernel. Only 
the SCSI hosts need a different initrd file.

How many hosts have you installed using fai? <b>about 70+</b>
Which version of fai are you using? <b>2.6.1</b>
Which version of fai-kernels are you using? using 1.8.1 currently, with 2.6 kernel,
   but have used other versions as well over the last year or so

How do you boot your host?
    I boot from a custom boot-cd, but have used both floppy and
    PXE boot in the past.  CD fits better into our environment.  The
    CD is basically just a boot CD: no deb archive or anything else.
    I generate the iso based on some script I found once (I think a Suse
    thing, but I'm not sure)

Does the default kernel recognize all your hardware?  Yes, but I do have 
   issues with the Compaq SmartArray controller.  I have found that if I 
   replace /usr/lib/fai/nfsroot/sbin/sfdisk with a copy from a woody 
   distribution, it all works fine (of course the disk_config needs to 
   understand about the /dev/ida mess as well... )

Used to configure and maintain Computer Science Department Linux Laboratories.

FAI significantly reduced installation time and is expected to reduce
upgrade times as well. Overall FAI is a great installer. FAI is
relatively easy to create a one of a kind installation of Linux, with
user defined configurations. We have added personalized settings such
as custom GDM logs as well as 3rd party applications, such as Matlab
and PPR Print Spooler.

However we did find the FAI documentation suffers from a number of
problems, including a failure to correctly explain how to use
Ether-boot instead of PXE and generally confusing terminology and
vague and imprecise wording. For example it took us a long time to
understand that the phrase "define a class" actually means to enable a
class. We almost gave up trying to use FAI due to the ambiguity of the
documentation. A thorough editing of the existing manual would go a
long way towards correcting this problem.

FAI is used to install several types of clients and servers on
different hardware. With help from kudzu and severall bash-scripts all
necessary hardware informations are detected.  FAI is only used for a
base installation (~60 packages) - our self developed software
management system then installs all remaining packages. It is also
later responsible for online-updates and configuration management. It
depends on FAIs class system.

How many hosts have you installed using fai? <b>113 hosts</b> (106 workstations and 7 compute servers)

Which version of fai are you using? <b>2.5.4</b>
Which version of fai-kernels are you using? Custom-built installation kernel to support newer hardware.

How do you boot your host?
  We boot all our hosts via PXE+DHCP at install-time.  Many hosts have
  3COM NICs (3c59x), some have Intel EtherExpress 1000 (e1000).

Does the default kernel recognize all your hardware?
  When we first started using FAI, the e1000 driver was missing from
  the kernel.  Also, some hardware had newer IDE controllers, so we
  built our own install kernel, which we are still using.  Most
  probably, though, by now the default FAI install kernel will work
  for us, but there is no need to switch.

<br /><b>Additional comments:</b> 
  We have over a hundred individual Linux workstations, about fifty
  older Sun workstations turned into diskless X terminals, connected
  to three Linux compute servers, a bunch of Win2000 machines and a
  bunch of specialized servers.  All of our user-accessible Linux
  machines have been switched from RedHat 7.3 to Debian 3.0 this Fall.

  This migration was a rather challenging task, but we are quite happy
  with Debian and FAI as the unattended installation method.  Now
  reinstalling a machine is as simple as rebooting it, since the
  boot-up is controlled from our PXE server.

  We use FAI to do a minimal installation, installing only the
  necessary packages.  All of the configuration is then done using
  Cfengine 2, which is also used later for keeping the configuration
  up-to-date.

  We like the fact that the concept of classes is shared by both FAI
  and Cfengine, and we use the same classes names for both systems.

  The biggest problem with FAI that we observed is that installing a
  number of machines in parallel (e.g. 14 machines) saturates the
  network and places a heavy load on the NFS server, hosting the
  mirror.

Many thanks for providing FAI!  Without it going to Debian would not
have been an option for us.

I implement firewalls, mail servers, fax servers, samba servers and terminal 
servers with FAI. 

All systems run for different customers on different hardware. I'm still 
struggling with the class concept to keep everything tidy. I manage my fai 
tree with CVS and I try to migrate to branched CVS now.

Some of the systems are not static, I'd like to see some restore procedure in 
FAI, to read back the actual state of passwd, shadow, group, named.conf, DNS 
zones and databases (mysql) from some directory tree or mounted backup media.
I think, this is a quite common scenario, so it shoud get into the examples.  

I had problems with SIS mainboards. Seem's, they had some undocumented      
bios bugs/features. They got very slow after 20 minutes, though Power Saving 
was completly disabled.

We have slightly different hardware and we needed to setup different

have to be installed. A machine type might be for example MySQL-,

To be able to install different machine types on different hardware i 
have implemented dialogs which will be shown when a new installation 
starts. In the first dialog one have to choose the hardware, afterwards 
the machine type and finally the servers name and ip address.

P.S. I´d like to mention, that FAI is an excellent piece of software.

Our purpose in using FAI is to customise the installer so it is easy
for our volunteers to use (many of them have never used Linux before).
I find the following components of FAI very useful:
  - Being able to put the installer on a bootable CD
  - Partitioning disks via config files
  - Choosing software sets based on the disk sizes/RAM of our
    computers
  - Good support via the mailing list

Things I don't like:
  - Scripts/hooks are not stable between releases, so I have to merge
    changes to scripts after each release or risk breakage. My current
    policy is to do all my customization via hooks, not scripts.
  - The chroot environment causes problems (e.g. in using dpkg)

I'm using it as Software deploy System in my local network. It currently
installs two kinds of Systems: a) A Dualboot Debian-Linux and Win2000
client ready to log in (Install time on a PIV: ~15 Minutes, sysprep run
included) b) A Debian system. Install time: 15 Minutes on a P166, 5-7
Minutes on a PIV.

I install a bootmanager which gives the user 5 Boot options: a) linux
normal b) Linux reinstall c) windows reinstall d) reinstall all e)windows

The system will be used to serve roughly 30-50 clients within the next
half year. Hopefully other faculties will use the system, too.

All in all: Yiepie! I can stop wasting time with client installation and
Maintainance. That was the piece missing to become a real System Architect
on a Linux System. Unfortunately, now my jumpstart installation will
become useless...guess my solaris boxen will run Linux too, soon. ;)

I found fai harder to learn than redhat's kickstart, but I found it to
be much more powerful. The documentation took some getting used to.

I was looking for a Backup/Recovery which I can control over remote
access. It should work for Linuxservers and Windows clients. Before
FAI I worked with Knoppix, which also can boot over network. But on
Knoppix you have to start sshd and set an password. With FAI I can
tell the clients in the network what they should do.

Setup of windows can cost a lot of time, even when there should run a
lot of special software. critical applications should have short
downtimes, when they crash. For Windows backup I used partimage 6.4.

Which version of fai are you using? As of 2004-05-24 we use <b>2.3.1</b>

We are using FAI to install (almost) all of the Linux-Systems (servers
and clients) in a mixed infrastructure (Windows 2000 and Debian/GNU
Linux). We built an environment for developement and testing of our
products (E.g.  www.geofox.de, a passenger timetable information
system written in Java), which need many systems with different configurations.

The characteristic of our infrastructure is the large number of
sometimes slightly different systems for which we need about 40
different configurations for about 70 installed systems in FAI. To
fit new requirements from these many different configurations we now
need to re-design and re-organize our fai setup.

At the moment we have eight (8!) FAI servers in our company: one for
production, one for testing and each member of the infrastructure team
has at least one "own" FAI server to develope and test FAI classes.

Using FAI we are able to maintain this heterogenous infrastructure by means
of about one admin. But of course the developement of new systems needs more manpower
as well as using new features of FAI like fai-bootcd or fai-configdir from cvs.

FAI is a very great tool, thanx for your nice job Thomas and all the other contributors !

While a little difficult to initially understand, once you have
grasped the core idea of FAI, it is very easy to use. We have an
experimental cluster intended for frequent re-installation. Since FAI
can install all 20 machines in about 8 minutes, we now do a
reinstallation when we want to upgrade/modify the installation,
instead doing individual modifications on the computers. There are no
user accounts on the machines themselves, so this works well.

How many hosts have you installed using fai?
   <b>160</b> workstations (30 stations use FAI only for install MS Windows image)
   <b>20</b> servers (plan is to next 30 servers install by FAI)
Which version of fai are you using? <b>2.5</b>
Which version of fai-kernels are you using? I use my own kernels.

How do you boot your host?
            from floppy: grub
       via network card: perex (special bootrom SW) and grub
   type of network card: 3c509, 3c905, ne2000

Does the default kernel recognize all your hardware?
I have a problem with AACRAID (not in older standard kernels) and I need
a fiber channel driver qla2300 (the driver is outside standard kernels).

<br /><b>Additional comments:</b>
Workstations are installed on demand (from bootmenu by user), logs are
sent by e-mail to administrators. We use BOOTP and DHCP, workstations
have bootroms and use Perex for netboot menu allowing users to select
boot options (operating system, reinstalation, help).  We often use
FAI for dual system installation (linux, windows). The FAI choses the
appropriate Windows image, uses 'dd' to write the partition and
resizes it to fit the target partition.

At the university, we use FAI to install AFS, DNS, BOOTP, DHCP,
database, print and other servers.

FAI is used to install cluster nodes and to do reproducible
installations of servers. According the fai-kernel version I have to
complete that for cluster nodes I use a self compiled kernel-package
with enabled "big memory (4GB)" option and without initrd. A lot of
unused features are removed (Irda, video, sound, firewire,...) For the
other hosts a recompiled kernel-package without initrd is used.

We started using FAI some years ago for the installation and the administration
of Linux desktop systems. Subsequently, we started deploying Linux servers with
the help of FAI. Our most recent FAI project was a Linux cluster with one master
(IBM x345) and 16 compute nodes (IBM x335).

For the administration of the clients, we use a stripped down version
of the FAI install script, which works quite well.

so that we can ship the IDS also as a cd standalone version. this will

Which version of fai are you using?<b>2.4.1</b>
Which version of fai-kernels are you using?  1.5.1

How do you boot your host? From floppy.

I've modified make-fai-bootfloppy quite a bit, added initrd support to
handle my nforce2 network card (I know you don't like this very much,
but there was no other way, plus I really wanted those
motherboards...). I still use DHCP to get network settings
though. I've also added an optional manual override to the network
settings during bootup, for computers whose DHCP settings are
unavailable. For this I had to hack ash/busybox a bit.

Does the default kernel recognize all your hardware? NO

Which drivers are missing: nvnet nForce2 network card.
Unfortunately this is a proprietary NVidia driver with no way of using
it besides via initrd. That's why I am also interested in fai-bootcd, 
which would make this problem go away.

Upgrading to Debian and simultaneous hacking of 
FAI is a rather slow process at the moment, given that people are still
using their computers...

<br /><b>Additional comments:</b>
Thanks for a very nice package! The Digital Signal Processing Lab here 
at the University of Stellenbosch has been a Linux environment for more 
than 7 years now. We've got about 30 machines running various distros, 
from Redhat 5 (!) to Debian sarge. They mostly serve as workstations and 
for running simulations.

I've helped push the lab towards Debian for ease of maintenance, and FAI 
fits right in there. Especially after reading infrastructures.org, I 
became convinced that this is a good road to go down. The biggest 
obstacle is the fact that the lab hardware is very heterogeneous. 
Sitting in South Africa, we mind our budget very carefully, and always 
go for the best deals we can get. Unfortunately we therefore don't buy
PXE network cards or 100 identical computers at a time. A lot of legacy
systems remain, combined with very recent and less supported hardware. 
The FAI system has made it easier, though, and I am satisfied with the
results so far.

I've been hacking at fai since May this year... I might send you patches 
once I've figured out what I've done myself :-&gt;

Thanks again for a nice system!

We have used FAI for installation of servers for some time now. Recently
we had to design an enviroment for storing and processing of
fMRI-scanner data (neuroimaging project for http://www.rug.nl/bcn).
These systems had to be installed and supported by non-linux staff. The
setup consists of servers, a SAN connection and about 40 workstations.
Installationprocedures are reduced to editing some files (dhcp, classes)
and pressing  &lt;F12&gt; (PXE networkboot) for an unattended install. In less
than 15 minutes a Debian GNU/Linux with software and vmware (for a
proprietary OS) is installed, preserving local data.

FAI is great stuff. Keep up the good work!

How do you boot your host? Currently we boot from floppy, then the

  part of a large network, so there is also a main bootptab running
  over yp-server and dhcp. There are problems due to this. We would

<br /><b>Additional comments:</b>
My biggest problems, I think, have always been with ssh. Notice above
what I had to do to get it running, and I &gt;STILL&lt; can't ssh in
to a installing machine. Much of this ssh setup should be
self-configuring during "fai-setup".

In general, though I'm thoroughly happy with FAI, I would have to say
that the version 1.3.1 should definitely NOT be in stable. The changes
I had to make there were extreme. Even tracking down the posix problem
in make-fai-nfsroot was a bit extreme. A typical user, simply
shouldn't be expected to go through such lengths.

Nevertheless, I would be very interested in your work for solaris. We
also have +20 Solaris machines, which I could possible tie into the one cluster.

<br /><b>Additional comments:</b>
I had the following questions about using fai, which eventually led me
to use a manual install rather than an fai install:

1.  Do I have to have RARP and NIS working on my server to use fai?
Off-topic:  Do RARP and NIS have to be working on my server in order
to execute a remote install, whether or not I am using fai to do it?

2.  Why can't debdist be 'unstable'?

3.  Isn't it true that _either_ FAI_DEBOOTSTRAP _or_ FAI_BASETGZ should 
be defined, but not both?  It's not clear whether all the configuration
parameters have to be set, and whether one should specifically not set
some parameters if others are set.

4.  I don't have a lot of space left on /usr/local/share, so I would have
liked to change the default value for FAI_CONFIGDIR.  But I needed to know
-- how big does this directory have to be?
-- what ownership/permissions does it need?  

5.  Why does the fai install process require fixed IP addresses?  I'd like to 
use dhcp without fixed addresses.  This problem was really the reason
why I finally decided to do the installation manually.

FWIW, this is my situation/configuration:
Currently, I run a sid system on my workstation.  For testing purposes, I 
also used debootstrap to install potato and woody on separate partitions.
Recently, I ran out of disk space, and decided to get a new computer
(because the disk controller is old and slow).  For this new computer,
I chose not to get yet another floppy and CD-ROM, since I rarely use either.  
Therefore, I needed to do a remote install.  I needed to build a custom 
kernel, since the motherboard (ASUS P4B) was fairly recent and required new 
drivers (particularly for the I845 chipset).  I often have need for DHCP 
here (Windows visitors), so I wanted to set up DHCP on my server anyway.  
I was trying to figure out how to use fai in such a way that I could 
(a) use my custom kernel, 
(b) use my woody partition that was already insalled on my current 
(old) workstation, and 
(c) use DHCP.  
When I finally succeeded in getting DHCP to recognize the NFS-boot server 
with the custom kernel I'd built, I went ahead and proceeded with the

How many host have you installed using fai ? <b>No complete installs.</b> Teething problems.
Which version of fai you are using ? <b>2.0</b>
 
How do you boot your host ? floppy disk.

Do you use bootp or dhcp ?  DHCP.  I have to support Windows clients as
well, and I wanted a single daemon to mess with, rather than several.

Does the default kernel recognize all your hardware ? On every machine tried so far.
<br /><b>Additional comments:</b>
Doesn't work on base2_3.tgz and woody packages. Intend to use Potato
install and an immediate upgrade to Woody on install clients.

<b>What is the business of your company/organisation?</b>
  Student-run computing lab at a university.
  University of Wollongong, IEEE Student Branch.
