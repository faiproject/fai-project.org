<h1>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h1>


<a name="download"></a>
<h2>Which repository do I have to use to get FAI for jessie/...?</h2>

<p>If you want to deploy Debian <strong>jessie</strong> the entry for
/etc/apt/sources.list and for /etc/fai/apt/sources.list should contain:</p>

<div class="featurebox"><h3> <!-- brrrrrr, this is dirty, Thomas!-->
<pre>
deb http://fai-project.org/download jessie koeln
</pre></h3></div>

This is the default setup, which uses the same distribution for the
server itself and the nfsroot. But you can also mix distributions
versions, for e.g. using a server running wheezy and create a jessie
nfsroot on this server. The distribution you want to deploy on your
clients is also independent from those defined here.

<a name="ubuntu"></a>
<h2>Is FAI available for Ubuntu?</h2>

<p>Yes, please visit <a href="https://launchpad.net/~fai/+archive/ppa">the PPA
  for Ubuntu FAI webpage</a> for details.</p>

<a name="kernel"></a>
<h2>I need a more recent hardware support/kernel version</h2>

<p>FAI by default uses the same kernel version as present in Debian.  Depending
on the time-frame since the last Debian release this kernel might not support
the most recent hardware. You can use the backports kernel or the grml
kernel. The <a href="http://grml.org/">Grml</a> live system
provides Debian packages of recent kernel versions which can be used within FAI,
just following <a href="https://wiki.fai-project.org/index.php/Grml_Kernel">the
  instructions from the Grml_Kernel page in the wiki</a>.</p>

<a name="dash"></a>
<h2>I get strange errors like 'ifclass: not found' during execution</h2>

<p>Debian supports /bin/dash as interpreter for /bin/sh. FAI uses bash scripts
which aren't supported by dash. If you notice errors like 'ifclass: not found'
during execution of FAI make sure to use '#!/bin/bash' as shebang line in your
scripts instead of '#!/bin/sh'.</p>

<a name="two_dhcp_servers"></a>
<h2>Using two DHCP daemons in the same subnet</h2>

<p>If you have two DHCP daemons in the subnet of your FAI infrastructure,
and one uses the option <em>allow unknown-clients</em> you are in trouble,
because if this daemon responses faster it will give the install
client an IP address and the other daemon has no chance to control the
clients boot parameters for FAI.</p>

<p>The solution for this problem is to use the '<em>ignore booting</em>'
instruction. So you have a DHCP daemon A which includes the <em>allow
  unknown-clients</em> option. In the same subnet you would like to run a second
DHCP daemon B for the FAI infrastructure which includes <em>deny
  unknown-clients</em> and contains a
list of all the install clients using their MAC address.</p>

<p>Since you know the MAC addresses of the install clients (that should be
controlled by B), you can instruct DHCP daemon A to ignore those clients.
For each install client you add a line into DHCPd.conf (of DHCP A) like
this:</p>

<div class="featurebox"><h3> <!-- brrrrrr, this is dirty, Thomas!-->
<pre>
host demohost {hardware ethernet 00:42:23:11:be:af;ignore booting;}
</pre></h3></div>

<p>That's it. If demohost does a PXE boot, DHCP A will ignore it, and
DHCP B can answer the request.</p>

<h2>Where should I report bugreports?</h2>

<p>Please report bugs against the according FAI Debian package (fai-client,
fai-server,...) using <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/reportbug">reportbug</a>
to <a
  href="http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/pkgreport.cgi?src=fai">bugs.debian.org</a>.
If you do not know how to use reportbug please write a mail to the <a
  href="/mailinglist/">linux-fai mailinglist</a>.</p>
